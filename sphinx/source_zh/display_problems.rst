Dealing With Display Problems
-----------------------------

As of version 6.13, Ren'Py will take advantage of graphics
acceleration hardware, if it's present and functional. Using hardware
acceleration brings with it several advantages, such as allowing
vertical-blank synchronization and scaling games to full-screen size
while preserving aspect ratio.

By default, Ren'Py selects a renderer to use in the following order:

1. OpenGL 2.0 or greater.
2. DirectX 9, provided that all libraries are available.
3. OpenGL 1.x.
4. Software.

A small fraction of systems may experience problems when running
hardware accelerated Ren'Py games.  These problems are often due to
buggy graphics drivers, and so your first step to fixing them should
be to check for an update to your graphics card drivers.

If upgrading your video drivers does not fix the problem, you should
consider switching video renderers, using the following steps.

1. Hold down shift while starting Ren'Py, or press shift+G once Ren'Py has started.
2. From the "Graphics Acceleration" menu that appears, choose the renderer to use.
3. Choose "Quit", then restart Ren'Py.

We suggest trying OpenGL, DirectX, and Software, in that order.
