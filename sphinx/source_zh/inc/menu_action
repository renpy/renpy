.. function:: MainMenu(confirm=True)
    
    Causes Ren'Py to return to the main menu.
    
    `confirm`
         If true, causes Ren'Py to ask the user if he wishes to
         return to the main menu, rather than returning
         directly.

.. function:: Quit(confirm=None)
    
    Quits the game.
    
    `confirm`
         If true, prompts the user if he wants to quit, rather
         than quitting directly. If None, asks if and only if
         the user is not at the main menu.

.. function:: ShowMenu(screen=None, *args, **kwargs)
    
    Causes us to enter the game menu, if we're not there already. If we
    are in the game menu, then this shows a screen or jumps to a label.
    
    `screen` is usually the name of a screen, which is shown using
    the screen mechanism. If the screen doesn't exist, then "_screen"
    is appended to it, and that label is jumped to.
    
    * ShowMenu("load")
    * ShowMenu("save")
    * ShowMenu("preferences")
    
    This can also be used to show user-defined menu screens. For
    example, if one has a "stats" screen defined, one can
    show it as part of the game menu using:
    
    * ShowMenu("stats")
    
    ShowMenu without an argument will enter the game menu at the
    default screen, taken from _game_menu_screen.
    
    Extra arguments and keyword arguments are passed on to the screen

.. function:: Start(label=u'start')
    
    Causes Ren'Py to jump out of the menu context to the named
    label. The main use of this is to start a new game from the
    main menu. Common uses are:
    
    * Start() - Start at the start label.
    * Start("foo") - Start at the "foo" label.
