.. function:: renpy.context()
    
    Returns an object that is unique to the current context. The object
    is copied when entering a new context, but changes to the copy do
    not change the original.
    
    The object is saved and participates in rollback.

.. function:: renpy.context_nesting_level()
    
    Returns the nesting level of the current context. This is 0 for the
    outermost context (the context that is saved, loaded, and rolled-back),
    and is non-zero in other contexts, such as menu and replay contexts.
