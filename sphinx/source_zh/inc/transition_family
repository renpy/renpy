.. function:: define.move_transitions(prefix, delay, time_warp=None, in_time_warp=None, out_time_warp=None, old=False, layers=[u'master'], **kwargs)
    
    This defines a family of move transitions, similar to the move and ease
    transitions. For a given `prefix`, this defines the transitions:
    
    * *prefix*- A transition that takes `delay` seconds to move images that
      changed positions to their new locations.
    
    * *prefix*\ inleft, *prefix*\ inright, *prefix*\ intop, *prefix*\ inbottom - Transitions
      that take `delay` seconds to move images that changed positions to their
      new locations, with newly shown images coming in from the appropriate
      side.
    
    * *prefix*\ outleft, *prefix*\ outright, *prefix*\ outtop, *prefix*\ outbottom -
      Transitions that take `delay` seconds to move images that changed
      positions to their new locations, with newly hidden images leaving via
      the appropriate side.
    
    `time_warp`, `in_time_warp`, `out_time_warp`
        Time warp functions that are given a time from 0.0 to 1.0 representing
        the fraction of the move complete, and return a value in the same
        range giving the fraction of a linear move that is complete.
    
        This can be used to define functions that ease the images around,
        rather than moving them at a constant speed.
    
        The three argument are used for images remaining on the screen,
        newly shown images, and newly hidden images, respectively.
    
    `old`
        If true, the transitions to move the old displayables, rather than the new ones.
    
    `layers`
        The layers the transition will apply to.
