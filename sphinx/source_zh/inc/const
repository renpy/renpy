.. function:: renpy.const(name)
    
    Declares a variable in the store to be constant.
    
    A variable is constant if nothing can change its value, or any value
    reached by indexing it or accessing its attributes. Variables must
    remain constant out of define, init, and translate python blocks.
    
    `name`
        A string giving the name of the variable to declare constant.

.. function:: renpy.not_const(name)
    
    Declares a name in the store to be not constant.
    
    This undoes the effect of calls to :func:`renpy.const` and
    :func:`renpy.pure`.
    
    `name`
        The name to declare not constant.

.. function:: renpy.pure(fn)
    
    Declares a function as pure. A pure function must always return the
    same value when it is called with the same arguments, outside of
    define, init, and translate python blocks.
    
    `fn`
        The name of the function to declare pure. This may either be a string
        containing the name of the function, or the function itself.
    
    Returns `fn`, allowing this function to be used as a decorator.
