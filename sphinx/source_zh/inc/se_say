.. function:: renpy.say(who, what, interact=True)
    
    The equivalent of the say statement.
    
    `who`
        Either the character that will say something, None for the narrator,
        or a string giving the character name. In the latter case, the
        :func:`say` is used to create the speaking character.
    
    `what`
        A string giving the line to say. Percent-substitutions are performed
        in this string.
    
    `interact`
        If true, Ren'Py waits for player input when displaying the dialogue. If
        false, Ren'Py shows the dialogue, but does not perform an interaction.
    
    This function is rarely necessary, as the following three lines are
    equivalent. ::
    
        e "Hello, world."
        $ renpy.say(e, "Hello, world.")
        $ e("Hello, world.")
