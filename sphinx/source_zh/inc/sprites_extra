.. function:: SnowBlossom(d, count=10, border=50, xspeed=(20, 50), yspeed=(100, 200), start=0, fast=False, horizontal=False)
    
    The snowblossom effect moves multiple instances of a sprite up,
    down, left or right on the screen. When a sprite leaves the screen, it
    is returned to the start.
    
    `d`
        The displayable to use for the sprites.
    
    `border`
        The size of the border of the screen. The sprite is considered to be
        on the screen until it clears the border, ensuring that sprites do
        not disappear abruptly.
    
    `xspeed`, `yspeed`
        The speed at which the sprites move, in the horizontal and vertical
        directions, respectively. These can be a single number or a tuple of
        two numbers. In the latter case, each particle is assigned a random
        speed between the two numbers. The speeds can be positive or negative,
        as long as the second number in a tuple is larger than the first.
    
    `start`
        The delay, in seconds, before each particle is added. This can be
        allows the particles to start at the top of the screen, while not
        looking like a "wave" effect.
    
    `fast`
        If true, particles start in the center of the screen, rather than
        only at the edges.
    
    `horizontal`
        If true, particles appear on the left or right side of the screen,
        rather than the top or bottom.
