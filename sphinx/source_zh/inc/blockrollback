.. function:: renpy.block_rollback()
    
    Prevents the game from rolling back to before the current
    statement.

.. function:: renpy.fix_rollback()
    
    Prevents the user from changing decisions made before the current
    statement.

.. function:: renpy.in_fixed_rollback()
    
    Returns true if rollback is currently occurring and the current
    context is before an executed renpy.fix_rollback() statement.

.. function:: ui.ChoiceJump(label, value, location=None, block_all=None)
    
    A menu choice action that returns `value`, while managing the button
    state in a manner consistent with fixed rollback. (See block_all for
    a description of the behavior.)
    
    
    `label`
        The label text of the button. For imagebuttons and hotspots this
        can be anything. This label is used as a unique identifier of
        the options within the current screen. Together with `location`
        it is used to store whether this option has been chosen.
    
    `value`
        The location to jump to.
    
    `location`
        A unique location identifier for the current choices screen.
    
    `block_all`
        If false, the button is given the selected role if it was
        the chosen choice, and insensitive if it was not selected.
    
        If true, the button is always insensitive during fixed
        rollback.
    
        If None, the value is taken from the :var:`config.fix_rollback_without_choice`
        variable.
    
        When true is given to all items in a screen, it will
        become unclickable (rolling forward will still work). This can
        be changed by calling :func:`ui.saybehavior` before the call
        to :func:`ui.interact`.
