.. function:: renpy.movie_cutscene(filename, delay=None, loops=0, stop_music=True)
    
    This displays an MPEG-1 cutscene for the specified number of
    seconds. The user can click to interrupt the cutscene.
    Overlays and Underlays are disabled for the duration of the cutscene.
    
    `filename`
        The name of a file containing an MPEG-1 movie.
    
    `delay`
        The number of seconds to wait before ending the cutscene.
        Normally the length of the movie, in seconds. If None, then the
        delay is computed from the number of loops (that is, loops + 1) *
        the length of the movie. If -1, we wait until the user clicks.
    
    `loops`
        The number of extra loops to show, -1 to loop forever.
    
    Returns True if the movie was terminated by the user, or False if the
    given delay elapsed uninterrupted.
