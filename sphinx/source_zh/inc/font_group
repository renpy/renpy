.. function:: FontGroup()
    
    A group of fonts that can be used as a single font.

    .. function:: add(font, start, end)
        
        Associates a range of characters with a `font`.
        
        `start`
            The start of the range. This may be a single-character string, or
            an integer giving a unicode code point.
        
        `end`
            The end of the range. This may be a single-character string, or an
            integer giving a unicode code point.
        
        When multiple .add() calls include the same character, the first call
        takes precedence.
        
        This returns the FontGroup, so that multiple calls to .add() can be
        chained together.
