.. function:: AlphaBlend(control, old, new, alpha=False)
    
    This transition uses a `control` displayable (almost always some sort of
    animated transform) to transition from one displayable to another. The
    transform is evaluated. The `new` displayable is used where the transform
    is opaque, and the `old` displayable is used when it is transparent.
    
    `alpha`
        If true, the image is composited with what's behind it. If false,
        the default, the image is opaque and overwrites what's behind it.
