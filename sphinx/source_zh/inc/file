.. function:: renpy.file(fn)
    
    Returns a read-only file-like object that accesses the file named `fn`. The file is
    accessed using Ren'Py's standard search method, and may reside in an RPA archive.
    or as an Android asset.
    
    The object supports a wide subset of the fields and methods found on python's
    standard file object, opened in binary mode. (Basically, all of the methods that
    are sensible for a read-only file.)

.. function:: renpy.list_files(common=False)
    
    Lists the files in the game directory and archive files. Returns
    a list of files, with / as the directory separator.
    
    `common`
        If true, files in the common directory are included in the
        listing.

.. function:: renpy.loadable(filename)
    
    Returns True if the given filename is loadable, meaning that it
    can be loaded from the disk or from inside an archive. Returns
    False if this is not the case.
