    Causes a transition to occur. This is the python equivalent of the
    with statement.
    
    `trans`
        The transition.
    
    `always`
        If True, the transition will always occur, even if the user has
        disabled transitions.
    
    This function returns true if the user chose to interrupt the transition,
    and false otherwise.
