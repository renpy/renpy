.. function:: Placeholder(base=None, full=False, flip=None, **properties)
    
    This displayable can be used to display a placeholder character or
    background.
    
    `base`
        The type of image to display. This should be one of:
    
        'bg'
            To display a background placeholder. This currently
            fills the screen with a light-gray, and displays
            the image name at the top of the screen.
    
        'boy'
            Displays a male-identified placeholder with the image
            name on his chest.
    
        'girl'
            Displays a female-identified placeholder with the image
            name on her chest.
    
        None
            Attempts to automatically determine the type of image
            to use. If the image name begins with "bg", "cg", or
            "event", uses 'bg'.
    
            Otherwise, contacts a web service to guess gender from
            the character's name, and uses that. (The 'girl' placeholder
            is used when the service can't guess.)
    
            The webservice will only be contacted when config.developer
            is True.
    
    `full`
        If true, a full-body sprite is used. Otherwise, a 3/4 sprite
        is used.
    
    `flip`
        If true, the sprite is flipped horizontally.
