.. function:: renpy.exists(filename)
    
    Returns true if the given filename can be found in the
    searchpath. This only works if a physical file exists on disk. It
    won't find the file if it's inside of an archive.
    
    You almost certainly want to use :func:`renpy.loadable` in preference
    to this function.

.. function:: renpy.fsdecode(s)
    
    Converts s from filesystem encoding to unicode.

.. function:: renpy.fsencode(s)
    
    Converts s from unicode to the filesystem encoding.

.. function:: renpy.image_size(im)
    
    Given an image manipulator, loads it and returns a (``width``,
    ``height``) tuple giving its size.
    
    This reads the image in from disk and decompresses it, without
    using the image cache. This can be slow.
