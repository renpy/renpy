.. function:: iap.purchase(product, interact=True)
    
    This function requests the purchase of `product`.
    
    It returns true if the purchase succeeds, or false if the purchase

        and :func:`iap.has_purchased` to represent this product.
    
    `identifier`
        A string that's used to identify the product internally. Once used
        to represent a product, this must never change. These strings are

        If None, defaults to `product`.

        iOS. If not given, defaults to `identifier`.
