.. function:: renpy.profile_screen(name, predict=False, show=False, update=False, request=False, time=False, debug=False, const=False)
    
    Requests screen profiling for the screen named `name`, which
    must be a string.
    
    Apart from `name`, all arguments must be supplied as keyword
    arguments. This function takes three groups of arguments.
    
    
    The first group of arguments determines when profiling occurs.
    
    `predict`
        If true, profiling occurs when the screen is being predicted.
    
    `show`
        If true, profiling occurs when the screen is first shown.
    
    `update`
        If true, profiling occurs when the screen is updated.
    
    `request`
        If true, profiling occurs when requested by pressing F8.
    
    The second group of arguments controls what profiling output is
    produced when profiling occurs.
    
    `time`
        If true, Ren'Py will log the amount of time it takes to evaluate
        the screen.
    
    `debug`
        If true, Ren'Py will log information as to how screens are
        evaluated, including:
    
        * Which displayables Ren'Py considers constant.
        * Which arguments, if any, needed to be evaluated.
        * Which displayables were reused.
    
        Producing and saving this debug information takes a noticeable
        amount of time, and so the `time` output should not be considered
        reliable if `debug` is set.
    
    The last group of arguments controls what output is produced once
    per Ren'Py run.
    
    `const`
        Displays the variables in the screen that are marked as const and
        not-const.
    
    All profiling output will be logged to profile_screen.txt in the game
    directory.
