.. class:: Tooltip(default)
    
    A tooltip object can be used to define a portion of a screen that is
    updated when the mouse hovers an area.
    
    A tooltip object has a ``value`` field, which is set to the `default`
    value passed to the constructor when the tooltip is created. When
    a button using an action created by the tooltip is hovered, the
    value field changes to the value associated with the action.

    .. method:: Action(value)
        
        Returns an action that is generally used as the hovered property
        of a button. When the button is hovered, the value field of this
        tooltip is set to `value`. When the button loses focus, the
        value field of this tooltip reverts to the default.
