.. function:: renpy.register_persistent(field, func)
    
    Registers a function that is used to merge values of a persistent field
    loaded from disk with values of current persistent object.
    
    `field`
        The name of a field on the persistent object.
    
    `function`
        A function that is called with three parameters, `old`, `new`, and
        `current`:
    
        `old`
            The value of the field in the older object.
    
        `new`
            The value of the field in the newer object.
    
        `current`
            The value of the field in the current persistent object. This is
            provided for cases where the identity of the object referred to
            by the field can't change.
    
        The function is expected to return the new value of the field in the
        persistent object.

.. function:: renpy.save_persistent()
    
    Saves the persistent data to disk.
