.. function:: Movie(fps=24, size=None, channel='movie', play=None, mask=None, mask_channel=None, image=None, **properties)
    
    This is a displayable that shows the current movie.
    
    `fps`
        The framerate that the movie should be shown at. (This is currently
        ignored, but the parameter is kept for backwards compatibility.
        The framerate is auto-detected.)
    
    `size`
        This should be specified as either a tuple giving the width and
        height of the movie, or None to automatically adjust to the size
        of the playing movie. (If None, the displayable will be (0, 0)
        when the movie is not playing.)
    
    `channel`
        The audio channel associated with this movie. When a movie file
        is played on that channel, it wil be displayed in this Movie
        displayable.
    
    `play`
        If given, this should be the path to a movie file. The movie
        file will be automatically played on `channel` when the Movie is
        shown, and automatically stopped when the movie is hidden.
    
    `mask`
        If given, this should be the path to a movie file that is used as
        the alpha channel of this displayable. The movie file will be
        automatically played on `movie_channel` when the Movie is shown,
        and automatically stopped when the movie is hidden.
    
    `mask_channel`
        The channel the alpha mask video is played on. If not given,
        defaults to `channel`_mask. (For example, if `channel` is "sprite",
        `mask_channel` defaults to "sprite_mask".)
    
    `image`
        An image that is displayed when `play` has been given, but the
        file it refers to does not exist. (For example, this can be used
        to create a slimmed-down mobile version that does not use movie
        sprites.) Users can also choose to fall back to this image as a
        preference if video is too taxing for their system.
    
    This displayable will be transparent when the movie is not playing.
