                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

                             Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
 below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
 becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must
 be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
 compilation and installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.

     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)

 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.

 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.

 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.

   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.

   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:

     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
     to use the modified definitions.)

     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
     performing this distribution.

     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
     specified materials from the same place.

     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.

   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.

   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.

   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.

 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.

 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
 countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.

   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.

                             NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
 of the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
 It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
 effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
 have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
 notice is found.


     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
 your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
 if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
   Random Hacker.

   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
   Ty Coon, President of Vice

 That's all there is to it!

Artistic License
================

::

                              The Artistic License
                          Version 2.0beta4, October 2000

                          Copyright (C) 2000, Larry Wall.
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                   Preamble

 This copyright license states the terms under which a given free
 software Package may be copied, modified and/or redistributed, while the
 Originator(s) maintain some artistic control over the future development
 of that Package (at least as much artistic control as can be given under
 copyright law while still making the Package open source and free software).

 This license is bound by copyright law, and thus it legally applies only
 to works which the copyright holder has permitted copying, distribution
 or modification under the terms of the Artistic License, Version 2.0.

 You are reminded that You are always permitted to make arrangements
 wholly outside of a given copyright license directly with the copyright
 holder(s) of a given Package. If the terms of this license impede your
 ability to make full use of the Package, You are encouraged to contact
 the copyright holder(s) and seek a different licensing arrangement.

                                 Definitions

 "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
 Originator(s), and derivatives of that collection of files created
 through textual modification.

 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or
 has been modified only in ways suggested by the Originator(s).

 "Modified Version" refers to the Package, if it has been changed by You
 via textual modification of the source code, and such changes were not
 suggested by the Originator(s).

 "Originator" refers to the author(s) and/or copyright holder(s) of the
 Standard Version of the Package.

 "You" and "Your" refers to any person who would like to copy,
 distribute, or modify the Package.

 "Distribution Fee" is any fee that You charge for providing a copy of
 this Package to another party. It does not refer to licensing fees.

 "Freely Available" means that:

        (a) no fee is charged for the right to use the item (though a
            Distribution Fee may be charged).

        (b) recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
            conditions they received it.

        (c) If the item is a binary, object code, bytecode, the complete
            corresponding machine-readable source code is included with the
            item.


          Permission for Use and Modification Without Redistribution

   (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
       Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
       you do not redistribute the Modified Version to others outside of your
       company or organization.


            Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

   (2) You may make available verbatim copies of the source code of the
       Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
       either gratis or for a Distribution Fee, provided that you duplicate
       all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
       Your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include compiled
       bytecode, object code or binary versions of the corresponding source
       code in the same medium.

   (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
       modifications made available from any of the Originator(s).  The
       resulting modified Package will still be considered the Standard
       Version, and may be copied, modified and redistributed under the terms
       of the original license of the Standard Version as if it were the
       Standard Version.


  Permissions for Redistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

   (4) You may modify your copy of the source code of this Package in any way
       and distribute that Modified Version (either gratis or for a
       Distribution Fee, and with or without a corresponding binary, bytecode
       or object code version of the Modified Version) provided that You
       clearly indicate what changes You made to the Package, and provided
       that You do at least ONE of the following:

        (a) make the Modified Version available to the Originator(s) of the
            Standard Version, under the exact license of the Standard
            Version, so that the Originator(s) may include your modifications
            into the Standard Version (at their discretion).

        (b) modify any installation scripts and procedures so that
            installation of the Modified Version will never conflict with an
            installation of the Standard Version, include for each program
            installed by the Modified Version clear documentation describing
            how it differs from the Standard Version, and rename your
            Modified Version so that the name is substantially different from
            the Standard Version.

        (c) permit and encourage anyone who receives a copy of the Modified
            Version permission to make your modifications Freely Available in
            some specific way.

       If Your Modified Version is in turn derived from a Modified Version
       made by a third party, then You are still required to ensure that Your
       Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.


       Permissions for Redistribution of Non-Source Versions of Package

   (5) You may distribute binary, object code, bytecode or other non-source
       versions of the Standard Version of the Package, provided that you
       include complete instructions on where to get the source code of the
       Standard Version.  Such instructions must be valid at the time of Your
       distribution.  If these instructions, at any time while You are
       carrying our such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new
       instructions on demand or cease further distribution.  If You cease
       distribution within thirty days after You become aware that the
       instructions are invalid, then You do not forfeit any of Your rights
       under this license.

   (6) You may distribute binary, object code, bytecode or other non-source
       versions of a Modified Version provided that You do at least ONE of
       the following:

        (a) include a copy of the corresponding source code for the Modified
            Version under the terms indicated in (4).

        (b) ensure that the installation of Your non-source Modified Version
            does not conflict in any way with an installation of the Standard
            Version, include for each program installed by the Modified
            Version clear documentation describing how it differs from the
            Standard Version, and rename your Modified Version so that the
            name is substantially different from the Standard Version.

        (c) ensure that the Modified Version includes notification of the
            changes made from the Standard Version, and offer to provide
            machine-readable source code (under a license that permits making
            that source code Freely Available) of the Modified Version via
            mail order.


         Permissions for Inclusion of the Package in Aggregate Works

   (7) You may aggregate this Package (either the Standard Version or
       Modified Version) with other packages and distribute the resulting
       aggregation provided that You do not charge a licensing fee for the
       Package.  Distribution Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for
       other packages in the aggregation are permitted.  Your permission to
       distribute Standard or Modified Versions of the Package is still
       subject to the other terms set forth in other sections of this
       license.

   (8) In addition to the permissions given elsewhere by this license, You
       are also permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions of this
       Package with other works and distribute the result without
       restriction, provided You have produced binary program(s) that do not
       overtly expose the interfaces of the Package.  This includes
       permission to embed the Package in a larger work of your own without
       exposing a direct interface to the Package.  This also includes
       permission to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of your
       scripts that require the Package, but do not otherwise give the casual
       user direct access to the Package itself.


         Items That are Never Considered Part of a Modified Version Package

   (9) Works (including, but not limited to, subroutines and scripts) that
       you have linked or aggregated with the Package that merely extend or
       make use of the Package, but are not intended to cause the Package to
       operate differently from the Standard Version, do not, by themselves,
       cause the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works
       are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not bound by
       the terms of the Package's license.


               Acceptance of License and Disclaimer of Warranty

  (10) You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
       it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify or
       distribute the Standard or Modified Versions of the Package.  These
       actions are prohibited by copyright law if you do not accept this
       License.  Therefore, by copying, modifying or distributing Standard
       and Modified Versions of the Package, you indicate your acceptance of
       the license of the Package.


  (11) Disclaimer of Warranty:
