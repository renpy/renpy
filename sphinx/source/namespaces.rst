Namespaces
==========

Ren'Py uses namespaces to organize variables and methods. This file contains descriptions of some of the
namespaces Ren'Py uses, primarily to help editors provide autocompletion and documentation.

.. var:: achievement

    A namespace that contains functions that grant and manage :doc:`achievements <achievement>`. This also contains much of
    the Steamworks integration.

.. var:: bubble:

    A namespace that contains variables that control the display of :doc:`dialogue bubbles <bubble>`.

.. var:: build:

    A namespace that contains variables that control the :doc:`build process <build>`.

.. var:: config:

    A namespace that contains variables that control the :doc:`configuration <config>` of Ren'Py. These variables should
    be set at init time (in ``init python`` blocks or with the ``define``) and should not be changed once the game
    has started.

.. var:: define:

    The define namespace contains functions that define new variables, such as families of transitions.

.. var:: director:

    The director namespace contains functions that control the :doc:`interactive director <director>`, which
    lets you insert images and music into the game interactively.

.. var:: gui

    The gui namespace contains functions that control the :doc:`default GUI system <gui>`. These variables only matter
    if you are using the default GUI system, and may not be used if you've replaced it. Define statements that
    affect the gui namespace are re-run when the translaton changes.

.. var:: iap

    The iap namespace contains functions that control the :doc:`in-app purchase system <iap>`.

.. var:: im

    **Note: Most functions in the im namespace are deprecated.**

    The im namespace contains image manipulators, which load or manipulate images on the CPU. Most functions here
    can be accomplished on the GPU using :class:`Transform`.

.. var:: layeredimage

    :doc:`Layered images <layeredimage>` are a way to combine multiple images into a single image, using attributes
    and conditions to control which images are shown. The layeredimage namespace contains classes that allow you
    to create and manipulate layered images from Python, the equivalent of the ``layeredimage`` statement.

.. var:: persistent

    The persistent namespace contains :doc:`persistent` data. Fields on this object start as None, and retain
    their values between runs of the game, even when not loading a save slot.

    The values of fields on the persistent object should be of Python-supplied types, like booleans, numbers,
    strings, lists, tuples, dicts, and sets. Classes you define should not be assigned to the persistent object.

.. var:: preferences

    The :doc:`preferences` namespace contains variables that contain preferences. While these can be read and set,
    the most common use is with the ``default`` statement, using syntax like::

        default preferences.fullscreen = True

.. var:: preferences.volume

    The :doc:`preferences` namespace contains variables that set the default volumes for each mixer. These should
    be set using the ``default`` statement, like::

        default preferences.volume.music = 0.5

.. var:: renpy

    The renpy namespace contains function and classes that are part of the Ren'Py engine itself. These can be the
    equivalent of Ren'Py language statements, or can introduce functionality that does not merit a dedicated statement.

.. var:: renpy.audio.filter

    The renpy.audio.filter namespace contains classes and functions that create :doc:`audio filters <audio_filters>`.

.. var:: renpy.music

    The renpy.audio.music namespace contains functions that control the :doc:`audio system <audio>`. These functions
    work with the music channel by default.

.. var:: renpy.sound

    The renpy.audio.sound namespace contains functions that control the :doc:`audio system <audio>`. These functions
    work with the sound channel by default. Most functions are documented under their renpy.music equivalents.

.. var:: style

    The style namespace contains styles and functions that manipulate styles. Styles are used to control the appearance
    of text, images, and other elements in Ren'Py. Using the ``style`` statement is preferred to using the style
    namespace directly.

.. var:: ui

    **Note: Most functions in the ui namespace are deprecated.**

    The ui namespace contains older functions and classes used to display user interface elements. With the the exception
    of ui.adjustment, ui.interact, ui.callsinnewcontext, and ui.invokesinnewcontext, these functions are
    obsolete.

.. var:: updater

    The updater namespace contains functions, classes, and variables that control the :doc:`HTTP/HTTPS <updater>`.
