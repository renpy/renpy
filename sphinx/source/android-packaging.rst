Building Android Applications
=============================

|PGS4A| contains tools that help you take a packaging-centric approach
to Android game development. In this approach, you will use a PC to
build an Android package and upload it to your device. You can then
run the game like any Android application. When it works correctly,
you can upload the package you make to the Android Market or other app
stores.

Building your first package takes four steps:

1. Download and install |PGS4A|, Python 2.7, the Java Development Kit,
   and Android USB Drivers (scroll down for links).

2. Use the ``android.py installsdk`` command to install the Android SDK and
   set up your development environment.

3. Use the ``android.py configure`` command to configure
   Android-specific settings in your game.

4. Use the ``android.py build`` command to build a package, and to
   install the package on your device.

Once you've finished these four steps, you'll have a runnable Android
package. You'll only need to run step 3 when you decide to make changes to your
game's configuration or when configuring a new game entirely; you'll run step
4 most often, whenever you need to make a new build of your game.


Host Platform Support
---------------------

We've tested |PGS4A| on Linux and Windows computers. While it should
work on Mac OS X, we haven't tested it there, so there may be problems
encountered. The examples we give will be for Linux and Windows.

The |PGS4A| tools are command-line based. We will try to assist you with
examples to familiarize you with the command line on Windows.


Step 1: Installing |PGS4A| and its Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------

There are four things you may need to manually download and install
before you can run |PGS4A|:

**Java Development Kit.**
The Java Development Kit (JDK) contains several tools that are used by
|PGS4A|, including the tools used to generate keys and sign
packages. It can be downloaded from:

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Please note that the developer-focused JDK is different from the
user-focused JRE, and you'll need the JDK to create Android packages.


**Python 2.7.**
Python 2.7 is required to run the android.py script that's
included with |PGS4A|. It can be downloaded from:

    http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/

|PGS4A| is not compatible with Python 3 at this time.


**Android Device Drivers.**
On Windows, you may want to install a device driver to access
your device, although this is not necessary. Links to android device drivers can be found at:

    http://developer.android.com/sdk/oem-usb.html

On Linux or OS X, you won't need a device driver. If you can't access
your device, you may need to read:

    http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html#setting-up

However, modern versions of Linux and OS X should just work.


.. ifconfig:: is_renpy

    **RAPT Itself.** The latest version of |PGS4A| can be downloaded from:

        |PGS4A_URL|

.. ifconfig:: not is_renpy

    **PGS4A Itself.** The latest version of |PGS4A| can be downloaded from:

        |PGS4A_URL|


Once |PGS4A| has been downloaded, you should extract it using an
archive program. The directory contained in that archive is what we
will refer to as the |PGS4A| directory.


Aside: Running android.py
-------------------------

In this documentation, we'll ask you to run the ``android.py``
command. The technique we use to run this varies based on the system
you're on.

In all cases, you should run ``android.py`` from within the |PGS4A|
directory. (That is, the directory containing ``android.py`` itself.)


On Windows, to do this, you will need to open up the command line by pressing
and holding down the Windows key and 'R'. In the small window that pops up
write "cmd" and press Enter. This should bring up the command line.

To run the command from within the |PGS4A| directory you need to navigate to it
from the command line. Find out where you extracted |PGS4A| and copy the path
from Explorer (just click in the address bar so the path turns blue and
press Ctrl+c). In the command prompt, write ``cd`` then a space, a
double-quote, paste the path you just copied from Explorer (right click and
choose ``paste``), then another double-quote.

.. ifconfig:: is_renpy

    Let's assume you extracted RAPT to C:\\tools\\RAPT. In the command line write::

        cd "C:\tools\RAPT"

.. ifconfig:: not is_renpy

    Let's assume you extracted PGS4A to C:\\tools\\PGS4A. In the command line write::

        cd "C:\tools\PGS4A"

Now you're within the |PGS4A| directory.

On Windows, if the .py extension is registered to Python 2.7, you then can
just run::

    android.py test

If you don't know what the above means or you don't want to do it, you
will have to add the full path to Python to each command in
the following steps of this guide beginning with 'android.py'. If you
installed Python to the default location, the above command would become::

    C:\python27\python.exe android.py test

If you installed Python to a different location, then find your Python install
in Explorer, click in the address bar and copy the path, then replace
``C:\python27`` with the path you copied instead - leaving ``\python.exe`` on the

end. So if your Python install is in ``C:\tools\python``, you would type::

    C:\tools\python\python.exe android.py test

.. warning::

    If the path to Python that you copied has any spaces in - for example, if you had installed it in the
    ``Program Files`` directory - you will need to put double quotes at the beginning of the whole
    command and just after ``python.exe``::

        "C:\Program Files\Python\python.exe" android.py test



On Linux, you may need to prefix the command with the current
directory::

   ./android.py test

For the rest of this documentation, we'll just use ``android.py`` - if you had to include the path
to Python in the example above, you will need to do the same thing every time you see ``android.py``
in these instructions.


Step 2: Set up the Android SDK and Development Environment
----------------------------------------------------------

The next step is to set up the Android SDK and the rest of your
development environment. This step will:

* Check that the JDK is installed properly.
* Install Apache Ant.
* Install the Android SDK.
* Use the Android SDK to install the appropriate development
  packages.
* Create a signing key that will be used to sign packages that are
  placed on the market (android.keystore: this will be generated in the |PGS4A| directory).

This step requires Internet access.

To perform this step, run::

   android.py installsdk

|PGS4A| will report on what it's doing. It will also prompt you with
warnings about licenses, and ask if you want it to generate a key.

.. warning::

   The key generated by |PGS4A| is created with a standard
   passphrase. You should really use keytool to generate your own
   signing keys.

    http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html

   At the very least, you should keep the android.keyring file in
   a safe place. You should also back it up, because without the
   key, you won't be able to upload the generated applications.


.. ifconfig:: not is_renpy

  Aside: A Simple Game
  --------------------

  To continue, we'll need a game to package. The section on
  :ref:`writing` explains how a simple game works. For now,
  you can make a game by:

  1. Creating the ``mygame`` directory underneath the |PGS4A|
     directory.

  2. In the ``mygame`` directory, create a file main.py. Place the
     following code into main.py::

      import pygame

      # Import the android module. If we can't import it, set it to None - this
      # lets us test it, and check to see if we want android-specific behavior.
      try:
          import android
      except ImportError:
          android = None

      # Event constant.
      TIMEREVENT = pygame.USEREVENT

      # The FPS the game runs at.
      FPS = 30

      # Color constants.
      RED = (255, 0, 0, 255)
      GREEN = (0, 255, 0, 255)

      def main():
          pygame.init()

          # Set the screen size.
          screen = pygame.display.set_mode((480, 800))

          # Map the back button to the escape key.
          if android:
              android.init()
              android.map_key(android.KEYCODE_BACK, pygame.K_ESCAPE)

          # Use a timer to control FPS.
          pygame.time.set_timer(TIMEREVENT, 1000 / FPS)

          # The color of the screen.
          color = RED

          while True:

              ev = pygame.event.wait()

              # Android-specific:
              if android:
                  if android.check_pause():
                      android.wait_for_resume()

              # Draw the screen based on the timer.
              if ev.type == TIMEREVENT:
                  screen.fill(color)
                  pygame.display.flip()

              # When the touchscreen is pressed, change the color to green.
              elif ev.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                  color = GREEN

              # When it's released, change the color to RED.
              elif ev.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
                  color = RED

              # When the user hits back, ESCAPE is sent. Handle it and end
              # the game.
              elif ev.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and ev.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                  break

      # This isn't run on Android.
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()

In the examples below, ``mygame`` is short for the path to the game
you're working on, relative to the current directory. When you make
your own game, you should change ``mygame`` to something else.
The easiest way to do this, of course, is to make a copy of your game's
directory inside the |PGS4A| directory and then replace ``mygame`` in
the examples below with the name of your game's directory.

Step 3: Configure Your Game
---------------------------

Before building a package, you must give |PGS4A| some information
about your game. You can do this with the following command::

    android.py configure mygame

This will ask you a series of questions about your game, and store
that information in a file in the game directory.

If you need to change the information - for example, if you release a
new version of your game - you can re-run the configure command. Your
previous choices will be remembered.


Step 4: Build and Install the Package
-------------------------------------

Finally, you can build and install the package. This is done with a
command like::

    android.py build mygame release install

This command will build a releasable version of your game, and then
install it on the connected device. Please look at the output of this
command to make sure it succeeds.

Once the game successfully installs, you can touch its icon in your
device's launcher to start it running.

If you'd rather just copy the game's apk file to your Android device manually, you can just run::

    android.py build mygame release

Then navigate to the 'bin' directory inside |PGS4A| and copy the file mygame-release.apk into your Android Device.
You will then need to find the .apk file in your Android device using your file application and open it to install the
game.

The build command passes the options after the game name to the ant
tool, which is responsible for creating the Android package. Other
commands are also possible - for a list, run::

    android.py build mygame help


Viewing Debug Output
--------------------

To view debug output from your application, run the logcat command::

    android.py logcat

This command runs the ``adb logcat`` command in a mode that selects
only Python output.

Troubleshooting and Support
---------------------------

Here's a list of errors that you might encounter and possible solutions:

When trying to run::

    android.py test

After having associated .py files with Python 2.7, if you get::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "C:\Visual Novels and Games\rapt-6.13.11.0\android.py", line 9, in <module>
        import subprocess
    File "C:\Python27\lib\subprocess.py", line 444, in <module>
        from _subprocess import CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP
    ImportError: cannot import name CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP

This may be related to having more than one version of Python installed on your system.
Try running android.py with the full path to Python, e.g.::

    C:\python27\python.exe android.py test

(If this works, then you will need to include the full path to Python in every command,
as if you didn't have the file type associated.)


If while downloading Apache Ant you get::

    IOError: [Errno socket error] [Errno 10054] An existing connection was forcibly
    closed by the remote host

Just try installing the sdk again with the same command.


If while configuring your game you get something like::

    Tag <manifest> attribute package has invalid character '-'.

You may have inserted an invalid character in the package name you used during
configuration (in this case a hyphen '-'). You'll have to use a different
package name which does not contain anything other than letters and dots.


If while configuring you get something like::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "android.py", line 66, in <module>
        main()
    File "android.py", line 44, in main
        configure.configure(iface, directory)
    File "buildlib\configure.py", line 108, in configure
        config.save(directory)
    File "buildlib\configure.py", line 30, in save
        with file(os.path.join(directory, ".android.json"), "w") as f:
    IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'mygame\\.android.json'

You should check whether you specified the correct path to your game directory. The easiest
way to be sure is to put your game's directory inside the |PGS4A| directory, and simply supply
the name of your game's directory. (If your game's directory name has spaces, you may need
to surround it with double quotes.)


If building your game gives you an error like:

    Error: Target id android-8 is not valid. Use 'android list targets' to get the target ids

You might want to check whether you have Android 2.2 (API 8) in the Android SDK manager.
You can run it by navigating to the android-sdk/tools directory inside the |PGS4A| directory
and run android.bat.

.. image:: android_sdk_manager_001.jpg
   :align: center

If Android 2.2 (API 8) is missing like in the above image, click 'Updates' and then 'Install Updates'.

Once the updates are installed, make sure Android 2.2 (API 8) and SDK platform are ticked:

.. image:: android_sdk_manager_005.jpg
   :align: center

And install the packages. Then, try building your game again.

.. ifconfig:: is_renpy

    If you still have questions or doubts you can try searching through or posting on the
    |PGS4A| thread over at the Lemmasoft forums:

        http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=13987&hilit=rapt

Expansion APKs
--------------

|PGS4A| optionally supports the use of expansion APKs when used on a
device supporting Google Play. Please see:

    http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html

For information about expansion APKs work. Right now, only the
main expansion APK is supported, giving a 2GB limit.

.. ifconfig:: not is_renpy

    When an android APK is created, all assets (from the assets
    directory) are placed in the expansion APK. The assets can be
    accessed through the :module:`android.assets` interface.

.. ifconfig:: is_renpy

    When an APK is created, all game files will be placed in the
    expansion APK. Ren'Py will transparently use these files.

|PGS4A| will place the expansion APK on the device when installing
the APK package on the device. In normal operation, Google Play will
place the expansion APK on the device automatically.
