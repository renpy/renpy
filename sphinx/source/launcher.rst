Launcher
========

The Ren'Py launcher is mostly documented in other portions of the manual. This
page contains information about the launcher that doesn't fit anywhere else.

Projects.txt
------------

If a file named ``projects.txt`` exists in the projects directory, it's expected
to contain a list of full paths, one per line. These paths are treated as if
they were inside the projects directory, and projects they contain show
up in the launcher.
