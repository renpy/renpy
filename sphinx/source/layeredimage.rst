Layered Images
==============

When a sprite-set gets to a certain level of complexity, defining every
possible combination may become unwieldy. For example, a character with
4 outfits, 4 hairstyles, and 6 emotions already has 96 possible
combinations. Creating static images for each possible combination would
consume a lot of disk space and programmer time.

To address this use case, Ren'Py introduces a way of defining an image
consisting of multiple sprites, organized in layers. (For the purpose of this,
consider layers to be the layers in a paint program like Photoshop or the GIMP,
and not the layers used elsewhere in Ren'Py.) Elements of these layers can be
selected by :ref:`attributes <concept-image>` provided to the image, or by
conditions that are evaluated at runtime.

These images can be declared using the ``layeredimage`` statement, using a
specific language. The :func:`LayeredImage` object is its Python alternative,
it's not a :doc:`displayable <displayables>` but can be assigned to an image
statement and used like one.

The bottom of this page contains advice and examples of use.

Defining Layered Images
=======================

The language used to define layered images consists of only a few statements,
to introduce the layers. Here is an example which, while not making much
practical sense, is technically correct and outlines the layeredimage syntax::

    layeredimage augustina:
        zoom 1.4
        at recolor_transform

        always:
            "augustina_base"

        attribute base2 default

        group outfit:
            attribute dress default:
                "augustina_dress"
            attribute uniform

        group face auto:
            pos (100, 100)
            attribute neutral default

    label start:
        show augustina # displaying dress and neutral
        aug "I like this dress."

        show augustina happy # auto-defined in the auto group
        aug "But what I like even more..."

        show augustina uniform -happy # uniform replaces dress, neutral replaces happy
        aug "Is this uniform !"

.. _layeredimage-statement:

Layeredimage
------------

The ``layeredimage`` statements opens the show. The statement is part of the
Ren'Py script language, and runs at :ref:`init time <init-phase>`. Like the
:ref:`atl-image-statement`, it takes an image name and opens a block, although
what's in the block differs greatly. The image name may contain spaces, just
like any other image name in Ren'Py.

Inside the block will fit the statements described further down, as well as the
following optional properties.

`image_format`
    When a given image is a string, and this is supplied, the image name
    is interpolated into `image_format` to make an image file. For example,
    "sprites/eileen/{image}.png" will look for the image in a subdirectory
    of sprites. (This is not used by auto groups, which look for defined images
    and not for image files.)

`format_function`
    A function that is used instead of :func:`layeredimage.format_function` to
    format the image information into a displayable, during the image definition
    at init time.

`attribute_function`
    A function or callable that is used to tweak what attributes end up being
    displayed. It is called with a set of attributes supplied to the image, and
    should return the set of attributes that should be used to select layers.
    It can be used to express complex dependencies between attributes, or to
    select attributes at random. See :ref:`attribute-selection-process` for more
    information about when and how this is called.

`at`
    A transform or list of transforms that are applied to the layered image.

:ref:`transform properties <transform-properties>`
    If given, these are used to construct a transform that is applied to the
    displayable.

`offer_screen`
    If this is True, the layeredimage will place its children, and size its
    children with variable size, like it was given an area matching the whole
    screen of the game. If it is False, the said behaviors will be done while
    taking into account the available area, which for example will be smaller
    in an hbox containing other elements, and the display of the layeredimage
    will not be consistent every time it is shown.

    If None, the default, falls back to :var:`config.layeredimage_offer_screen`,
    which defaults to True.

Always
------

The ``always`` statement declares an image that is always shown inside the
layeredimage, and which will not be attached to an attribute. It
must be supplied a displayable, and can also take properties. Both can
be placed on the same line or inside a block.

The ``always`` statement takes the following properties:

`if_all`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    given, this layer is only displayed if all of the named attributes
    are present.

`if_any`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    given, this layer is only displayed if any of the named attributes
    are present.

`if_not`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    given, this layer is only displayed if none of the named attributes are
    present.

:ref:`transform properties <transform-properties>`
    If given, these are used to construct a transform that is applied
    to the displayable.

`at`
    A transform or list of transforms that are applied to the provided
    displayable.

If
^^

The ``if`` statement (or more fully the if-elif-else statement) allows you
to supply one or more conditions that are evaluated at runtime. Each
condition is associated with a displayable, with the first true condition
being the one that is shown. If no condition is true, the ``else`` layer
is shown if given.

A more complete example of an ``if`` statement might look like::

    if glasses == "evil":
        "augustina_glasses_evil"
    elif glasses == "normal":
        "augustina_glasses"
    elif glasses == "funky":
        "augustina_glasses_clown"
    else:
        "augustina_nose_mark"

Each clause must be given a displayable. It can also be given these properties:

`if_all`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    given, this condition is only considered if all of the named attributes
    are present.

`if_any`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    given, this condition is only considered if any of the named attributes
    are present.

`if_not`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    given, this condition is only considered if none of the named attributes are
    present.

:ref:`transform properties <transform-properties>`
    If present, these are used to construct a transform that is applied
    to the displayable.

`at`
    A transform or list of transforms that are applied to the displayable.

The ``if`` statement is transformed to a :func:`ConditionSwitch` when the
``layeredimage`` statement runs.

.. var:: layeredimage.predict_all = None

    Sets the value of `predict_all` for the ConditionSwitches produced
    by layeredimages' ``if`` statements.

When ``predict_all`` is not true, changing the condition of the if statement
should be avoided while the layered image is shown or about to be shown,
as it would lead to an unpredicted image load. It's intended for use for
character customization options that don't change often.

Attribute
---------

The ``attribute`` statement adds a displayable that is part of the resulting
image when the given attribute is used to display it. For example, using the
previous example, calling ``show augustina dress`` will cause the
"augustina_dress" to be shown as part of the "augustina" image.

An ``attribute`` clause takes an attribute name, which is one word. It can also
take two keywords. The ``default`` keyword indicates that the attribute should
be present by default unless an attribute in the same group is called. The
``null`` keyword prevents this clause from getting attached a displayable, which
can be useful for bookkeeping and to build conditional display conditions using
`if_all`, `if_any`, `if_not`, `attribute_function`,
:var:`config.adjust_attributes` or :var:`config.default_attributes`.

The same attribute name
can be used in multiple ``attribute`` clauses (and in auto-defined attributes as
part of ``auto`` groups, more about that later), with all the corresponding
displayables being shown at the same time (the `if_all`, `if_any`, and `if_not`
properties can tweak this).

If the displayable is not explicitly given, it will be computed from the name
of the layeredimage, the group (if any), the group's variant (if any), and the
attribute. See the :ref:`pattern <layeredimage-pattern>` section for more
details.

The attribute statement takes the following properties:

`if_all`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    present, this layer is only displayed if all of the named attributes
    are present.

`if_any`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    present, this layer is only displayed if any of the named attributes
    are present.

`if_not`
    A string or list of strings giving the names of attributes. If this is
    present, this layer is only displayed if none of the named attributes are
    present.

:ref:`transform properties <transform-properties>`
    If present, these are used to construct a transform that is applied
    to the layer.

`at`
    A transform or list of transforms that are applied to the layer.

The `if_*` clauses' test is based upon the list of attributes of the resulting
image, as explained :ref:`here <concept-image>`, but it **does not change** that
list. ::

    layeredimage eileen:
        attribute a
        attribute b default if_not "a"
        attribute c default if_not "b"

In this example, the ``b`` and ``c`` attributes are *always* part of the attributes
list (because of their ``default`` clause). When calling ``show eileen a``, the
``a`` attribute will be displayed as requested, and the ``b`` attribute will not,
due to its ``if_not`` property. But even if not displayed, the ``b`` attribute will
still be part of the attributes list, which means the ``c`` attribute will still not
display.

Group
-----

The ``group`` statement groups attributes together, making them mutually
exclusive. Unless the group is ``multiple``, when attributes `a` and `b` are in
the same group, it is an error to include both of the attributes at the same
time, with ``show eileen a b`` for example. In the same example, calling
attribute `a` will hide attribute `b`, and vice versa. However, note that it's
fine for several ``attribute`` clauses to be passed the same name, *even within
the same group*. In that case, they will be considered as one attribute
containing several sprites - more about that at the end of this section.

The ``group`` statement takes a name. The name isn't used for very much, except
to generate the default names of attributes inside the group. That is not the
case for ``multiple`` groups in which the name doesn't have any use or impact.

The name may be followed by the ``auto`` keyword. If it's present, after any
attributes in the group have been declared, Ren'Py will scan its list of images
for those that match the group's pattern (see :ref:`below <layeredimage-pattern>`),
with the specificity that in that case, a multiple group's name _is_ part if the
pattern, and that the ``format_function`` passed to the layeredimage is ignored.
Any images that are found, except those corresponding to explicitly declared
attributes, are then added to the group as if declared using the ``attribute``
statement inside the group's block. See the :ref:`layeredimage-examples` section
for a practical demo.

This can be followed by the ``multiple`` keyword. If present, no incompatibility
is applied to the attributes declared inside the block. This is useful to have a
group auto-define multiple attributes that are not exclusive, or to apply the
same properties to a set of attributes at once. This conflicts with the
``default`` keyword being given to one of the attributes. Note that ``multiple``
groups are very different from other, normal groups, and that most of what's
true about groups doesn't apply to them.

After these optional keywords, properties can then be declared on the first line
of the group, and it can take a block containing properties and attributes.

The group statement takes the properties ``attribute`` does - such as
``if_any``, ``at`` and so on. Properties supplied to the group are passed to
the attributes inside the group, unless overridden by the same property of the
attribute itself. In addition, there are two properties which are specific to
groups:

`variant`
    If given, this should be a string. If present, it adds an element that becomes
    part of automatically-generated image names, and of the pattern used to search
    for images when automatically defining attributes in ``auto`` groups.

`prefix`
    If given, this is a prefix that is concatenated using an underscore with the
    manually or automatically defined attribute names. So if prefix is "leftarm",
    and the attribute name "hip" is encountered, ``show eileen leftarm_hip``
    will display it.

An attribute may also be part of several groups, in which case the attribute is
incompatible with every other attribute in every group it's part of. This can be
useful for example for a `dress` attribute, to make it hide both any top and any
pants that may be showing when it gets displayed::

    layeredimage eileen:
        attribute base default
        group bottom:
            attribute jeans default
            attribute dress null
        group top:
            attribute shirt default
            attribute dress

When several ``group`` blocks with the same name are defined in the same
layeredimage, they are considered to be different parts of a single group. For
example::

    layeredimage eileen sitting:
        attribute base default
        group arms variant "behind":
            attribute on_hips
            attribute on_knees
            attribute mixed
        attribute table default
        group arms variant "infront":
            attribute on_table default
            attribute holding_margarita
            attribute mixed

In this example, ``eileen_sitting_arms_behind_mixed.png`` will contain her
left arm behind the table, and ``eileen_sitting_arms_infront_mixed.png`` will
contain her right arm on the table. When calling ``show eileen sitting mixed``,
the two images will be shown at the same time, respectively behind and in front
of the table. In this example, the `on_hips` attribute is incompatible with the
`on_table` attribute, because even though they are not declared in the same
block, they are both in the same group.

.. _layeredimage-pattern:

Pattern and format function
===========================

The pattern, used to find images for attributes when they are not explicitly
given one, consists of:

* The name of the layeredimage, with spaces replaced with underscores.
* The name of the group, if any and if the group is not ``multiple``.
* The name of the variant, if there is one.
* The name of the attribute.

all combined with underscores. For example, if we have a layered image with the
name "augustina work", and the group "eyes", this will match images that match
the pattern augustina_work_eyes\_\ `attribute`. With a `variant` of `blue`, it
would match the pattern augustina_work_eyes_blue\_\ `attribute`. In the
following example::

    layeredimage augustina work:
        group eyes variant "blue":
            attribute closed

The attribute is linked to the image ``"augustina_work_eyes_blue_closed"``. That
can resolve to an image file named "augustina_work_eyes_blue_closed.png", but it
can also be defined explicitly using the :ref:`image-statement` for example.

If you want a ``multiple`` group's name to be included in the pattern, you can
use the following syntax::

    group addons multiple variant "addons"

All of the pattern behavior can be changed using a `format_function`:
:func:`layeredimage.format_function` is the function used under the hood to
implement the behavior described above. You can see what arguments it takes, in
case you want to supply your own `format_function` to replace it.

.. include:: inc/li_ff

Proxying Layered Images
=======================

Sometimes, it can be useful (and even necessary) to proxy a layered image, to
use the same layered image in multiple places. One reason for this would be to
have a transformed version of a given layeredimage, while another would be to
use it as a side image.

The :func:`LayeredImageProxy` object does this, taking one layered image and
duplicating it somewhere else. For example::

    image dupe = LayeredImageProxy("augustina")

creates a duplicate of the image that can be displayed independently. This
also takes a transform argument that makes it useful to position a side
image, like this::

    image side augustina = LayeredImageProxy("augustina", Transform(crop=(0, 0, 362, 362), xoffset=-80))

See the difference::

    image sepia_augustina_one = Transform("augustina", matrixcolor=SepiaMatrix())
    image sepia_augustina_two = LayeredImageProxy("augustina", Transform(matrixcolor=SepiaMatrix()))

``sepia_augustina_one`` will be a sepia version of the *original version* of the
"augustina" layeredimage, in other words what's shown when you don't provide it
any attribute. On the contrary, ``sepia_augustina_two`` will take any attribute
"augustina" does, and then apply the sepia effect onto the result. If you can do
this::

    show augustina happy eyes_blue dress

then::

    show sepia_augustina_one happy eyes_blue dress
    # won't work, because Transform doesn't take attributes

    show sepia_augustina_two happy eyes_blue dress
    # will work, and show "augustina happy eyes_blue dress" in sepia effect

.. include:: inc/li_proxy

.. _attribute-selection-process:

Selecting attributes to display
===============================

Several factors influence what gets displayed following a given
:ref:`show-statement`. To provide more clarity as to what happens in which
order, this section showcases the life of a set of attributes, from the show
statement to the on-screen display.

- The ``show`` statement provides the initial set of attributes, following the
  image tag.
- If a :var:`config.adjust_attributes` function exists to match
  the image tag, it is called, and returns a potentially different set of
  attributes. If so, it replaces the former set, which is forgotten.
- If a :var:`config.default_attribute_callbacks` function exists and if its
  trigger conditions are met, it is called and potentially adds attributes to
  the set.

The previous stages are not specific to layeredimages, because it is only after
this stage that renpy determines which image or layeredimage will be called to
display. For that reason, the given set of attributes must lead to one, and only
one, defined image (or layeredimage, Live2D...), using the behavior described in
the :ref:`show statement section <show-statement>`.

- Then, the provided attributes are combined with the attributes defined in the
  layeredimage, discarding some previously shown attributes and conserving
  others. This is also the point when unrecognized attributes are detected and
  related errors are raised. If no such error is raised, the new attributes,
  along with those which were not discarded, will be recognized by renpy as the
  set of attributes associated with that image tag. This computing takes some
  of the incompatibility constraints into account, but not all. For instance
  incompatibilities due to attributes being in the same non-multiple group will
  trigger at this point in time, but the if_any/if_all/if_not clauses will not.
  That's why an attribute called but negated by such a clause will be considered
  active by renpy, and will for example become visible without having to be
  called again, if at some point the condition of the if\_x clause is no longer
  fulfilled.
- If an ``attribute_function`` has been provided to the layeredimage, it is
  called with the set of remaining attributes. It returns a potentially
  different set of attributes.
- This set is once again confronted with the incompatibility constraints of the
  layeredimage, this time in full. That is the final stage, and remaining
  attributes are called into display.

Advice
======

**Use underscores in image filenames.**

By default, Ren'Py's layered images use underscores to separate sections
of image names. It might be tempting to use images with spaces between
sections, but that could lead to problems later on.

Ren'Py has a rule that if you show an image with the exact name as one
that's being shown, it's shown instead. This can bypass the layered image
you defined and show the sprite directly on its own, which can lead to weird problems
like a pair of eyes floating in space.

By having each sprite have a different tag from the main image, this is no
longer a problem.


**Cropping layers isn't necessary.**

Ren'Py optimizes images by cropping them to the bounding box of the
non-transparent pixels before loading them into RAM. As a result, assuming
the images are being predicted properly, it generally won't improve
performance or image size much to crop the images yourself.


**Layered images shouldn't use data that changes at runtime.**

Note that with the exception of the conditions in the ``if`` statement, all
expressions written in a ``layeredimage`` block are evaluated at init time, when
the layered image is first defined. This is not the case for ATL transforms for
example, or for anything occurring in :var:`config.adjust_attributes`,
:var:`config.default_attributes` or ``attribute_function``, but it is the case
for ``format_function`` which is also only called at layeredimage definition.


**Choosing what syntax to use**

If you want a sprite to be always visible, use either the ``always`` clause or
the ``attribute x default`` syntax. ``always`` will require you to provide the
displayable explicitly (automatic attribution using the
:ref:`pattern <layeredimage-pattern>` will not be available), but ``attribute``
will spend the "x" attribute name which will always be active for that
layeredimage.

If you want it to appear depending on the attributes being passed to the
layeredimage at the moment of the ``show`` statement, for example
``show eileen happy`` instead of ``show eileen jeans``, use the ``attribute``
statement, in or out of a ``group`` block (or implicitly defined in an ``auto``
group).

If you want it to appear depending on a python variable or condition, use the
``if`` statement.

If you want it to depend on both (for example for ``show eileen ribbon`` to show
either a blue or red ribbon depending on a variable, but no ribbon appearing
unless you ask for it with the ``ribbon`` attribute), declare all versions as
attributes and use a dedicated :var:`config.adjust_attributes` function.


.. _layeredimage-examples:

Examples
========

**Pattern and auto groups**

From the following files in the images/ directory (or one of its subfolders) and
written code:

.. a code-block and not a ::, because it's not proper renpy syntax

.. code-block:: none

    francis_base.png
    francis_face_neutral.png
    francis_face_angry.png
    francis_face_happy.png
    francis_face_very_happy.png
    francis_face annoyed.png
    francis_supersad.png

::

    layeredimage francis:
        attribute base default
        group face auto
            attribute neutral default
        attribute supersad:
            Solid("#00c3", xysize=(100, 100))

The ``francis`` layeredimage will declare the (defaulted) ``base`` attribute,
and associate it the "francis_base" (auto-defined) image using the
:ref:`pattern <layeredimage-pattern>` : the layeredimage name ("francis"), the
group name (none here), the variant name (none here) and the attribute name
("base"), separated with underscores.

Then, in the ``face`` group, the explicit ``neutral`` attribute gets associated
the "francis_face_neutral" image, following the same pattern but using "face"
as the group name and "neutral" as the attribute name.

After all explicit attributes receive their images, ``face`` being an ``auto``
group, existing images (auto-defined or not) are scanned for a match with the
pattern. Here, three are found : "francis_face_angry", "francis_face_happy" and
"francis_face_very_happy". They are associated with the ``angry``, ``happy`` and
``very_happy`` attributes respectively, using the same pattern as before. No
``annoyed`` attribute is defined however, since the "francis_face annoyed" image
contains a space where the pattern expected an underscore.

Finally, the ``supersad`` attribute is declared, but since a displayable is
explicitly provided, the pattern does not look for a matching image.

The "francis_supersad" and "francis_face annoyed" images get auto-defined from
the filename as part of Ren'Py's ordinary :ref:`protocol <images-directory>`,
but these sprites don't find a match with any attribute or auto group, so they
end up not being used in the ``francis`` layeredimage.

As you can see, using the pattern to associate images to attributes and using
auto groups shrinks the code considerably. The same layeredimage would have
taken 13 lines if everything was declared explicitly (try it!), and this syntax
allows for geometric growth of the sprite set - adding any number of new faces
wouldn't require any change to the code, for example.


**Dynamism in attributes**

Here is an example for defining attributes depending on variables (as mentioned
in the Advice section)::

    layeredimage eileen:
        attribute base default
        group outfit auto
        group ribbon prefix "ribbon":
            attribute red
            attribute blue

    default eileen_ribbon_color = "red"

    init python:
        def eileen_adjuster(names):
            atts = set(names[1:])
            if "ribbon" in atts:
                atts.remove("ribbon")
                atts.add("ribbon_" + eileen_ribbon_color)
            return names[0], *atts

    define config.adjust_attributes["eileen"] = eileen_adjuster
