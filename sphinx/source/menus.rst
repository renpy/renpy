=============
In-Game Menus
=============

In many visual novels, the player is asked to make choices that
control the outcome of the story. The Ren'Py language contains a ``menu``
statement that makes it easy to present choices to the user.

Here's an example of a ``menu`` statement::

    menu:
         "What should I do?"

         "Drink coffee.":
             "I drink the coffee, and it's good to the last drop."

         "Drink tea.":
             $ drank_tea = True

             "I drink the tea, trying not to make a political statement as I do."

         "Genuflect.":
             jump genuflect_ending

    label after_menu:

         "After having my drink, I got on with my morning."

The ``menu`` statement begins with the keyword ``menu``. This may be followed
by a label name, in which case it's equivalent to preceding the menu
with that label. For example::

    menu drink_menu:
        ...

The menu statement is followed by an indented block. This block may
contain a :ref:`say statement <say-statement>`, and must contain at
least one menu choice. If the say statement is present, it is
displayed on the screen at the same time as the menu.

**Menu Choices.**
A menu choice is an option the user can select from the in-game
menu. A menu choice begins with a string. The string may be followed
by an if-clause, which makes the choice conditional. The menu choice
ends with a colon, and must be followed by a block of Ren'Py
statements.

When the choice is selected, the block of statements is run. If execution
reaches the end of the block, it continues with the statement
after the end of the menu statement.

An if-clause consists of the keyword ``if``, followed by a Python
expression. The menu choice is only displayed if the expression is
true. In the following menu::

    menu:
        "Go left.":
            ...
        "Go right.":
            ...
        "Fly above." if drank_tea:
            ...

The third choice will only be presented if the ``drank_tea`` variable is
true. (However if, the :var:`config.menu_include_disabled` variable is set
to True, it will be shown as a disabled button.)


.. _menu-set:

Menu Set
--------

A menu can take a set clause, on a line by itself. If present, only items
with captions that are not in the set are displayed as part of the menu.
When a choice is selected, the caption of that choice can be added to the
set.

As with all menus, if no choices are available it advances to the statement
after the menu.

For historical reasons, the set can be either a set object or a list.

::

    default menuset = set()


    menu chapter_1_places:

        set menuset
        "Where should I go?"

        "Go to class.":
            jump go_to_class

        "Go to the bar.":
            jump go_to_bar

        "Go to jail.":
            jump go_to_jail

    menu chapter_1_after_places:

        "Wow, that was one heck of a Tuesday."


.. _menu-arguments:

Menu Arguments
--------------

It's possible to pass arguments to the menu itself, and to the individual
choices in a menu. To pass arguments to the menu, add them to the
menu line, after the optional name, and immediately before the colon. To
pass arguments to a menu choice, put them after the menu string and before
the ``if`` keyword or colon. ::


    menu ("jfk", screen="airport"):

        "Chicago, IL" (200):
            jump chicago_trip

        "Dallas, TX" (150, sale=True):
            jump dallas_trip

        "Hot Springs, AR" (300) if secret_unlocked:
            jump hot_springs_trip

Menu arguments passed to the menu itself become arguments to the screen,
except the `screen` argument which selects the screen, and the `nvl` argument
that selects the :ref:`NVL-mode menu <nvl-mode-menu>`. The arguments to
the choices become arguments to the items passed to the menu screen.

See the documentation for :ref:`the choice screen <choice-screen>` and
:var:`config.menu_arguments_callback`.
