Chrome OS/Chromebook
====================

There are two ways to run Ren'Py under Chrome OS.

Android on Chrome OS
--------------------

The easiest way to make a game available for Chrome OS is to package it for
Android, as described in the :ref:`Android documentation <android>`. Ren'Py's
Android support was designed with Chrome OS in mind as well.

This mode only supports playing games, not developing new games.

Linux on Chrome OS
------------------

Ren'Py games and the Ren'Py SDK can also be installed on a Chromebook. This allows
you to develop Ren'Py games on your Chromebook.

To install it:

1. Install Linux for Chrombebook, as described at https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en .

2. Change the Crosstini GPU Support setting to enabled, by typing chrome://flags/#crostini-gpu-support, and choosing enable.

3. Restart your Chromebook.

4. Upgrade Linux, by launching a terminal, and running::

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt dist-upgrade

5. Restart your Chromebook, again.

To install a version of Ren'Py, open a terminal and run::

    wget https://www.renpy.org/dl/7.4.0/renpy-7.5.0-sdkarm.tar.bz2
    tar xaf renpy-7.5.0-sdkarm.tar.bz2

To run that version of Ren'Py, open a terminal and run::

    cd ~/ab/renpy-7.5.0-sdkarm
    ./renpy.sh

Note that this works with other versions of Ren'Py if you change 7.5.0
for another version.

A SDK installed in this way can be used to run games that do not natively
support ARM chromebooks on an ARM chromebook. Just unpack the game into
the projects directory and hit refresh, then launch it through the
Ren'Py launcher. (The projects directory can be set in preferences.)
