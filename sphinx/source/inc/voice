.. function:: _get_voice_info()
    
    Returns information about the voice being played by the current
    say statement. This function may only be called while a say statement
    is executing.
    
    The object returned has the following fields:
    
    .. attribute:: VoiceInfo.filename
    
        The filename of the voice to be played, or None if no files
        should be played.
    
    .. attribute:: VoiceInfo.auto_filename
    
        The filename that Ren'Py looked in for automatic-voicing
        purposes, or None if one could not be found.
    
    .. attribute:: VoiceInfo.tag
    
        The voice_tag parameter supplied to the speaking Character.
    
    .. attribute:: VoiceInfo.sustain
    
        False if the file was played as part of this interaction. True if
        it was sustained from a previous interaction.

.. function:: voice(filename, tag=None)
    
    Plays `filename` on the voice channel. The equivalent of the voice
    statement.
    
    `filename`
        The filename to play. This is used with
        :var:`config.voice_filename_format` to produce the
        filename that will be played.
    
    `tag`
        If this is not None, it should be a string giving a
        voice tag to be played. If None, this takes its
        default value from the voice_tag of the Character
        that causes the next interaction.
    
        The voice tag is used to specify which character is
        speaking, to allow a user to mute or unmute the
        voices of particular characters.

.. function:: voice_can_replay()
    
    Returns true if it's possible to replay the current voice.

.. function:: voice_replay()
    
    Replays the current voice, if possible.

.. function:: voice_sustain(ignored=u'', **kwargs)
    
    The equivalent of the voice sustain statement.
