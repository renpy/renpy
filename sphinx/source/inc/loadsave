.. Automatically generated file - do not modify.

.. function:: renpy.can_load(filename, test=False)
    
    Returns true if `filename` exists as a save slot, and False otherwise.

.. function:: renpy.list_saved_games(regexp='.', fast=False)
    
    Lists the save games. For each save game, returns a tuple containing:
    
    * The filename of the save.
    * The extra_info that was passed in.
    * A displayable that, when displayed, shows the screenshot that was
      used when saving the game.
    * The time the game was stayed at, in seconds since the UNIX epoch.
    
    `regexp`
        A regular expression that is matched against the start of the
        filename to filter the list.
    
    `fast`
        If fast is true, the filename is returned instead of the
        tuple.

.. function:: renpy.list_slots(regexp=None)
    
    Returns a list of non-empty save slots. If `regexp` exists, only slots
    that begin with `regexp` are returned. The slots are sorted in
    string-order.

.. function:: renpy.load(filename)
    
    Loads the game state from the save slot `filename`. If the file is loaded
    successfully, this function never returns.

.. function:: renpy.newest_slot(regexp=None)
    
    Returns the name of the newest save slot (the save slot with the most
    recent modification time), or None if there are no (matching) saves.
    
    If `regexp` exists, only slots that begin with `regexp` are returned.

.. function:: renpy.rename_save(old, new)
    
    Renames a save from `old` to `new`. (Does nothing if `old` does not
    exist.)

.. function:: renpy.save(filename, extra_info='')
    
    Saves the game state to a save slot.
    
    `filename`
        A string giving the name of a save slot. Despite the variable name,
        this corresponds only loosely to filenames.
    
    `extra_info`
        An additional string that should be saved to the save file. Usually,
        this is the value of :var:`save_name`.
    
    :func:`renpy.take_screenshot` should be called before this function.

.. function:: renpy.slot_json(slotname)
    
    Returns the json information for `slotname`, or None if the slot is
    empty.

.. function:: renpy.slot_mtime(slotname)
    
    Returns the modification time for `slot`, or None if the slot is empty.

.. function:: renpy.slot_screenshot(slotname)
    
    Returns a display that can be used as the screenshot for `slotname`,
    or None if the slot is empty.

.. function:: renpy.take_screenshot(scale=None, background=False)
    
    Causes a screenshot to be taken. This screenshot will be saved as part of
    a save game.

.. function:: renpy.unlink_save(filename)
    
    Deletes the save slot with the given name.
