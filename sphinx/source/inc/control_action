    Causes the current interaction to return the supplied value, which
    must not be None. This is often used with menus and imagemaps, to

    was called using the ``call screen`` statement, the return value
    is placed in the `_return` variable.
    
    When in a menu, this returns from the menu. (The value should be
    None in this case.)

.. function:: Show(screen, transition=None, *args, **kwargs)

.. function:: ShowTransient(screen, transition=None, *args, **kwargs)
    
    Shows a transient screen. A transient screen will be hidden when
    the current interaction completes. The arguments are
