.. function:: Movie(fps=24, size=None, **properties)
    
    This is a displayable that shows the current movie.
    
    `fps`
        The framerate that the movie should be shown at. (This is currently
        ignored, but the parameter is kept for backwards compatibility.
        The framerate is auto-detected.)
    
    `size`
        This should always be specified. A tuple giving the width and height
        of the movie.
    
    The contents of this displayable when a movie is not playing are undefined.
    (And may change when a rollback occurs.)
