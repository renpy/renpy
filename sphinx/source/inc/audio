.. function:: renpy.play(filename, channel=None, **kwargs)
    
    Plays a sound effect. If `channel` is None, it defaults to
    :var:`config.play_channel`. This is used to play sounds defined in
    styles, :propref:`hover_sound` and :propref:`activate_sound`.

.. function:: renpy.seen_audio(filename)
    
    Returns True if the given filename has been played at least once on the current
    user's system.

.. function:: renpy.music.get_pause(channel='music')
    
    Returns the pause flag for `channel`.

.. function:: renpy.music.get_playing(channel='music')
    
    If the given channel is playing, returns the playing file name.
    Otherwise, returns None.

.. function:: renpy.music.get_pos(channel='music')
    
    Returns the amount of time that has elapsed since the audio on
    `channel` started playing, in seconds. Returns None if no audio is playing
    on `channel`.

.. function:: renpy.music.is_playing(channel='music')
    
    Returns True if the channel is currently playing a sound, False if
    it is not, or if the sound system isn't working.

.. function:: renpy.music.play(filenames, channel='music', loop=None, fadeout=None, synchro_start=False, fadein=0, tight=None, if_changed=False)
    
    This stops the music currently playing on the numbered channel, dequeues
    any queued music, and begins playing the specified file or files.
    
    `filenames`
        This may be a single file, or a list of files to be played.
    
    `channel`
        The channel to play the sound on.
    
    `loop`
        If this is True, the tracks will loop while they are the last thing
        in the queue.
    
    `fadeout`
        If not None, this is a time in seconds to fade for. Otherwise the
        fadeout time is taken from config.fade_music.
    
    `synchro_start`
        Ren'Py will ensure that all channels of with synchro_start set to true
        will start playing at exactly the same time. Synchro_start should be
        true when playing two audio files that are meant to be synchronized
        with each other.
    
    `fadein`
        This is the number of seconds to fade the music in for, on the
        first loop only.
    
    `tight`
        If this is True, then fadeouts will span into the next-queued sound.
    
    `if_changed`
        If this is True, and the music file is currently playing,
        then it will not be stopped/faded out and faded back in again, but
        instead will be kept playing. (This will always queue up an additional
        loop of the music.)
    
    This clears the pause flag for `channel`.

.. function:: renpy.music.queue(filenames, channel='music', loop=None, clear_queue=True, fadein=0, tight=None)
    
    This queues the given filenames on the specified channel.
    
    `filenames`
        This may be a single file, or a list of files to be played.
    
    `channel`
        The channel to play the sound on.
    
    `loop`
        If this is True, the tracks will loop while they are the last thing
        in the queue.
    
    `clear_queue`
        If True, then the queue is cleared, making these files the files that
        are played when the currently playing file finishes. If it is False,
        then these files are placed at the back of the queue. In either case,
        if no music is playing these files begin playing immediately.
    
    `fadein`
        This is the number of seconds to fade the music in for, on the
        first loop only.
    
    `tight`
        If this is True, then fadeouts will span into the next-queued sound.
    
    This clears the pause flag for `channel`.

.. function:: renpy.music.register_channel(name, mixer=None, loop=None, stop_on_mute=True, tight=False, file_prefix='', file_suffix='', buffer_queue=True, movie=False)
    
    This registers a new audio channel named `name`. Audio can then be
    played on the channel by supplying the channel name to the play or
    queue statements.
    
    `mixer`
        The name of the mixer the channel uses. By default, Ren'Py
        knows about the "music", "sfx", and "voice" mixers. Using
        other names is possible, but may require changing the
        preferences screens.
    
    `loop`
        If true, sounds on this channel loop by default.
    
    `stop_on_mute`
        If true, music on the channel is stopped when the channel is muted.
    
    `tight`
        If true, sounds will loop even when fadeout is occurring. This should
        be set to True for a sound effects or seamless music channel, and False
        if the music fades out on its own.
    
    `file_prefix`
        A prefix that is prepended to the filenames of the sound files being
        played on this channel.
    
    `file_suffix`
        A suffix that is appended to the filenames of the sound files being
        played on this channel.
    
    `buffer_queue`
        Should we buffer the first second or so of a queued file? This should
        be True for audio, and False for movie playback.
    
    `movie`
        If true, this channel will be set up to play back videos.

.. function:: renpy.music.set_pan(pan, delay, channel='music')
    
    Sets the pan of this channel.
    
    `pan`
        A number between -1 and 1 that control the placement of the audio.
        If this is -1, then all audio is sent to the left channel.
        If it's 0, then the two channels are equally balanced. If it's 1,
        then all audio is sent to the right ear.
    
    `delay`
        The amount of time it takes for the panning to occur.
    
    `channel`
        The channel the panning takes place on. This can be a sound or a music
        channel. Often, this is channel 7, the default music channel.

.. function:: renpy.music.set_pause(value, channel='music')
    
    Sets the pause flag for `channel` to `value`. If True, the channel
    will pause, otherwise it will play normally.

.. function:: renpy.music.set_queue_empty_callback(callback, channel='music')
    
    This sets a callback that is called when the queue is empty. This
    callback is called when the queue first becomes empty, and at
    least once per interaction while the queue is empty.
    
    The callback is called with no parameters. It can queue sounds by
    calling renpy.music.queue with the appropriate arguments. Please
    note that the callback may be called while a sound is playing, as
    long as a queue slot is empty.

.. function:: renpy.music.set_volume(volume, delay=0, channel='music')
    
    Sets the volume of this channel, as a fraction of the volume of the
    mixer controlling the channel.
    
    `volume`
        This is a number between 0.0 and 1.0, and is interpreted as a fraction
        of the mixer volume for the channel.
    
    `delay`
        It takes delay seconds to change/fade the volume from the old to
        the new value. This value is persisted into saves, and participates
        in rollback.
    
    `channel`
        The channel to be set

.. function:: renpy.music.stop(channel='music', fadeout=None)
    
    This stops the music that is currently playing, and dequeues all
    queued music. If fadeout is None, the music is faded out for the
    time given in config.fade_music, otherwise it is faded for fadeout
    seconds.
    
    This sets the last queued file to None.
    
    `channel`
        The channel to stop the sound on.
    
    `fadeout`
        If not None, this is a time in seconds to fade for. Otherwise the
        fadeout time is taken from config.fade_music.
