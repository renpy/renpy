.. Automatically generated file - do not modify.

.. function:: FileCurrentPage()
    
    Returns the current file page as a string.

.. function:: FileCurrentScreenshot(empty=None, **properties)
    
    A displayable that shows the screenshot that will be saved with the current
    file, if a screenshot has been taken when entering a menu or with
    :func:`FileTakeScreenshot`.
    
    If there is no current screenshot, `empty` is shown in its place. (If `empty` is
    None, it defaults to :func:`Null`.)

.. function:: FileJson(name, key=None, empty=None, missing=None, page=None)
    
    Accesses the Json information associated with `name`.
    
    If `key` is None, returns the entire Json other object, or `empty` if the slot
    is empty.
    
    Otherwise, this returns json[key] if `key` is defined on the json object of the save,
    `missing` if there is a save with the given name, but it does not contain `key`, or
    `empty` if the save slot is empty.
    
    Json is added to a save slot by callbacks registered using :var:`config.save_json_callbacks`.

.. function:: FileLoadable(name, page=None)
    
    This is a function that returns true
    if the file is loadable, and false otherwise.

.. function:: FileNewest(name, page=None)
    
    Returns True if this is the newest file slot, or False otherwise.

.. function:: FilePageName(auto='a', quick='q')
    
    Returns the name of the current file page, as a string. If a normal
    page, this returns the page number. Otherwise, it returns
    `auto` or `quick`.

.. function:: FileSaveName(name, empty='', page=None)
    
    Return the save_name that was in effect when the file was saved,
    or `empty` if the file does not exist.

.. function:: FileScreenshot(name, empty=None, page=None)
    
    Returns the screenshot associated with the given file. If the
    file is not loadable, then `empty` is returned, unless it's None,
    in which case, a Null displayable is created.
    
    The return value is a displayable.

.. function:: FileSlotName(slot, slots_per_page, auto='a', quick='q', format='%s%d')
    
    Returns the name of the numbered slot. This assumes that slots on
    normal pages are numbered in a linear order starting with 1, and
    that page numbers start with 1. When slot is 2, and slots_per_page
    is 10, and the other variables are the defaults:
    
    * When the first page is showing, this returns "2".
    * When the second page is showing, this returns "12".
    * When the auto page is showing, this returns "a2".
    * When the quicksave page is showing, this returns "q2".
    
    `slot`
        The number of the slot to access.
    
    `slots_per_page`
        The number of slots per page.
    
    `auto`
        A prefix to use for the auto page.
    
    `quick`
        A prefix to use for the quick page.
    
    `format`
        The formatting code to use. This is given two arguments: A string
        giving the page prefix, and an integer giving the slot number.

.. function:: FileTime(name, format='%b %d, %H:%M', empty='', page=None)
    
    Returns the time the file was saved, formatted according
    to the supplied `format`. If the file is not found, `empty` is
    returned.
    
    The return value is a string.

.. function:: FileUsedSlots(page=None, highest_first=True)
    
    Returns a list of used numeric file slots on the page.
    
    `page`
        The name of the page that will be scanned. If None, the current page
        is used.
    
    `highest_first`
        If true, the highest-numbered file slot is listed first.
        Otherwise, the lowest-numbered slot is listed first.
