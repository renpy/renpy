Reserved Names
==============

Ren'Py reserves filenames that are do not begin with a letter or number,
and filenames that begin with "00". Very specifically, filenames that start
with "00" and "\_" are used by Ren'Py internally.

Ren'Py reserves all names beginning with a single underscore (\_). Do not
use names beginning with an underscore, as that may cause your game to break
in future versions of Ren'Py.

The following is a list of names that are used by Python. Re-using these
names can lead to obscure problems.

.. include:: inc/reserved_builtins

The following are reserved names imported from the Python
`typing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_  module into all Ren'Py stores.

* Any
* Callable
* Literal
* Self
* cast
* final
* overload
* override

The following is a list of names that are used by Ren'Py. While in some
cases it makes sense to redefine these names, one should be aware that doing
so can cause obscure problems.
