msgid "Ren'Py is written in the Python programmming language, and includes support for including python code inside Ren'Py scripts. Python support can be used for many things, from setting a flag to creating new displayables. This chapter covers ways in which Ren'Py scripts can directly invoke Ren'Py code, through the various python statements."
