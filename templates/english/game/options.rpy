    ## These settings let you customize the window containing the
    ## dialogue and narration, by replacing it with an image.

    ## The background of the window. In a Frame, the two numbers
    ## are the size of the left/right and top/bottom borders,
    ## respectively.

    # style.window.background = Frame("frame.png", 12, 12)

    ## Margin is space surrounding the window, where the background
    ## is not drawn.

    # style.window.left_margin = 6
    # style.window.right_margin = 6
    # style.window.top_margin = 6
    # style.window.bottom_margin = 6

    ## drawn.

    # style.window.left_padding = 6
    # style.window.right_padding = 6
    # style.window.top_padding = 6

    #########################################
    ## This lets you change the placement of the main menu.

    ## The way placement works is that we find an anchor point
    ## inside a displayable, and a position (pos) point on the
    ## screen. We then place the displayable so the two points are
    ## at the same place.

    ## An anchor/pos can be given as an integer or a floating point
    ## number. If an integer, the number is interpreted as a number
    ## of pixels from the upper-left corner. If a floating point,
    ## the number is interpreted as a fraction of the size of the
    ## displayable or screen.

    # style.mm_menu_frame.xpos = 0.5
    # style.mm_menu_frame.xanchor = 0.5
    # style.mm_menu_frame.ypos = 0.75
    # style.mm_menu_frame.yanchor = 0.5

    ## The file containing the default font.

    ## Note that these only change the size of some of the text. Other
    ## buttons have their own styles.
