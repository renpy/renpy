        give the size of the Model. If not given, the model is the size
        of the area provided to it. The fit parameter to a texture takes
        precedence.

    If no mesh method is called, a mesh that sets a_position and a_tex_coord
    to match the way Ren'Py loads textures is created if at least one texture
    is supplied. Otherwise, a mesh that only sets a_position is used.

    All methods on this calls return the displayable the method is called
    on, making it possible to chain calls.
