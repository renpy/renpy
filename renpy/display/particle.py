    calling :meth:`SpriteManager.create`.

        number is, the closer to the viewer the sprite is.

    `events`
        If True, then events are passed to child. If False, the default,

            of seconds until the function is called again, and the
            SpriteManager is rendered again.

        `event`
            If not None, a function that is called when an event occurs.
            It takes as arguments:

            sprite manager is.

        `ignore_time`
            If True, then time is ignored when rendering displayables. This

    The snowblossom effect moves multiple instances of a sprite up,
    down, left or right on the screen. When a sprite leaves the screen, it
    is returned to the start.

    `d`
        The displayable to use for the sprites.

    `border`
        The size of the border of the screen. The sprite is considered to be
        on the screen until it clears the border, ensuring that sprites do
        not disappear abruptly.

    `xspeed`, `yspeed`
        The speed at which the sprites move, in the horizontal and vertical
        directions, respectively. These can be a single number or a tuple of
        two numbers. In the latter case, each particle is assigned a random
        speed between the two numbers. The speeds can be positive or negative,
        as long as the second number in a tuple is larger than the first.

    `start`
        The delay, in seconds, before each particle is added. This can be
        allows the particles to start at the top of the screen, while not
        looking like a "wave" effect.

    `fast`
        If true, particles start in the center of the screen, rather than
        only at the edges.

    `horizontal`
        If true, particles appear on the left or right side of the screen,
        rather than the top or bottom.

    `distribution`
        A function or the name of a built-in distribution function to determine the starting position of a particle.

        If a string, must be one of the following:
        - `linear`: Value has an equal chance of being anywhere along an axis.
        - `gaussian`: Value is more likely to be near the middle and less likely to be near the edges.
        - `arcsine`: Value is more likely to be near the edges and less likely to be near the middle.

        If a function, it must take two floats as arguments and return a float.

        Default is `linear`.

    `animation`
            If True, then this SnowBlossom uses the animation timebase.
            This prevents it from resetting when shown twice.
