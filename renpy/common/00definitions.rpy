        This defines a family of move transitions, similar to the move and ease
        transitions. For a given `prefix`, this defines the transitions:

        * *prefix*- A transition that takes `delay` seconds to move images that
          changed positions to their new locations.

        * *prefix*\ inleft, *prefix*\ inright, *prefix*\ intop, *prefix*\ inbottom - Transitions
          that take `delay` seconds to move images that changed positions to their
          new locations, with newly shown images coming in from the appropriate
          side.

        * *prefix*\ outleft, *prefix*\ outright, *prefix*\ outtop, *prefix*\ outbottom -
          Transitions that take `delay` seconds to move images that changed
          positions to their new locations, with newly hidden images leaving via
          the appropriate side.

        `time_warp`, `in_time_warp`, `out_time_warp`        
            Time warp functions that are given a time from 0.0 to 1.0 representing
            the fraction of the move complete, and return a value in the same 
            range giving the fraction of a linear move that is complete.
            
            This can be used to define functions that ease the images around,
            rather than moving them at a constant speed.
            
            The three argument are used for images remaining on the screen,
            newly shown images, and newly hidden images, respectively.

        `old`
            If true, the transitions to move the old displayables, rather than the new ones.

        `layers`        
            The layers the transition will apply to.
