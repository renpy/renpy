        This class supports the creation of an image gallery by handling the
        locking of images, providing an action that can show one or more images,
        and a providing method that creates buttons that use that action.

        .. attribute:: transition

            The transition that is used when changing images.

        .. attribute:: locked_button

            The default displayable used by make_button for a locked button.

        .. attribute:: hover_border

            The default hover border used by make_button.

        .. attribute:: idle_border

            The default idle border used by make_button.

        .. attribute:: unlocked_advance

            If true, the gallery will only advance through unlocked images.

        .. attribute:: navigation

            If true, the gallery will display navigation and slideshow
            buttons on top of the images.

            To customize the look of the navigation, you may override the
            gallery_navigation screen. The default screen is defined in
            renpy/common/00gallery.rpy

        .. attribute:: span_buttons

            If true, the gallery will advance between buttons.

        .. attribute:: slideshow_delay

            The time it will take for the gallery to advance between images
            in slideshow mode.

        .. attribute:: image_screen = "_gallery"

            The screen that is used to show individual images in this gallery.
            This screen is supplied the following keyword arguments:

            `locked`
                True if the image is locked.

                A list of transformed displayables that should be shown to the user.

                The image gallery object.

            `show_` in calls to Gallery.image and Gallery.unlock image.
