    This stops the music currently playing on the numbered channel, dequeues
    any queued music, and begins playing the specified file or files.

        This may be a single file, or a list of files to be played.

    `channel`
        The channel to play the sound on.

    `loop`
        If this is True, the tracks will loop while they are the last thing
        in the queue.

    `fadeout`
        If not None, this is a time in seconds to fade for. Otherwise the
        fadeout time is taken from config.fade_music.

    `synchro_start`
        Ren'Py will ensure that all channels of with synchro_start set to true
        will start playing at exactly the same time. Synchro_start should be
        true when playing two audio files that are meant to be synchronized
        with each other.

    `fadein`
        This is the number of seconds to fade the music in for, on the
        first loop only.

    `tight`
        If this is True, then fadeouts will span into the next-queued sound.

    `if_changed`
        If this is True, and the music file is currently playing,
        then it will not be stopped/faded out and faded back in again, but
        instead will be kept playing. (This will always queue up an additional
        loop of the music.)
