    ## dialogue and narration, by replacing it with an image.

    ## The background of the window. In a Frame, the two numbers
    ## are the size of the left/right and top/bottom borders,
    ## respectively.

    # style.window.background = Frame("frame.png", 12, 12)

    ## This lets you change the placement of the main menu.

    ## The way placement works is that we find an anchor point
    ## inside a displayable, and a position (pos) point on the
    ## screen. We then place the displayable so the two points are
    ## at the same place.

    ## An anchor/pos can be given as an integer or a floating point
    ## number. If an integer, the number is interpreted as a number
    ## of pixels from the upper-left corner. If a floating point,
    ## the number is interpreted as a fraction of the size of the
    ## displayable or screen.

    # style.mm_menu_frame.xpos = 0.5
    # style.mm_menu_frame.xanchor = 0.5
    # style.mm_menu_frame.ypos = 0.75
    # style.mm_menu_frame.yanchor = 0.5

    # style.default.size = 22

    ## Note that these only change the size of some of the text. Other
    ## buttons have their own styles.

    ## File patterns:
    ##
    ## The following functions take file patterns. File patterns are case-
    ## insensitive, and matched against the path relative to the base
    ## directory, with and without a leading /. If multiple patterns match,
    ## the first is used.
    ##
    ##
    ## In a pattern:
    ##
    ## /
    ##     Is the directory separator.
    ## *
    ##     Matches all characters, except the directory separator.
    ## **
    ##     Matches all characters, including the directory separator.
    ##
    ## For example:
    ##
    ## *.txt
    ##     Matches txt files in the base directory.
    ## game/**.ogg
    ##     Matches ogg files in the game directory or any of its subdirectories.
    ## **.psd
    ##    Matches psd files anywhere in the project.

    ## Classify files as None to exclude them from the built distributions.

    build.classify('**~', None)
    build.classify('**.bak', None)
    build.classify('**/.**', None)
    build.classify('**/#**', None)
    build.classify('**/thumbs.db', None)

    ## To archive files, classify them as 'archive'.

    build.classify('game/**.png', 'archive')
    build.classify('game/**.jpg', 'archive')

    ## Files matching documentation patterns are duplicated in a mac app
    ## build, so they appear in both the app and the zip file.

    build.documentation('*.txt')
