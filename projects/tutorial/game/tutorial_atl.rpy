    e "There are two main kinds of numbers in Python: integers and floating point numbers. An integer consists entirely of digits, while a floating point number has a decimal point."

    e "For example, 100 is an integer, while 0.5 is a floating point number, or float for short. In this system, there are two zeros: 0 is an integer, and 0.0 is a float."

    e "Ren'Py uses integers to represent absolute coordinates, and floats to represent fractions of an area with known size."

    show example atl_transform
